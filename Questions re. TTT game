questions:

how to repeat the game? I wrote a function but there are problems with it:

-  when repeating the game, the new list of all numbers is not used and the
   programme continues to use the original list, i.e. with the numbers that
   are left from the previous game;

-  in some cases, after only one or two choices, the programme already declares
   a winner; it seems the choices of the previous game are still used even
   though the list of available squares is renewed and the board is new;

-  the programme also declares a winner when 3 in a row is X X O;

-  HOW TO REPEAT GAME WITHOUT FUNCTIONS start_game() AND new_board()?

-  should pickle/unpickle be used?
