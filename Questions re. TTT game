questions:

how to repeat the game? I wrote a function but there are problems with it:

-  when repeating the game, the new list of all numbers is not used and the
   programme continues to use the original list, i.e. with the numbers that
   are left from the previous game;

-  after only one entry, the programme already declares a winner;
